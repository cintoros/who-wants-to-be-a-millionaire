            <h2>Welcome to Who Wants to be a Millionaire!</h2>
            <h3><a href="http://localhost:9876">Click here to go to the game</a></h3>

            <h3>Project work at the University of Applied Sciences FHNW</h3>
            <p>
                This is a project work within the module: Web Engineering. I was allowed to submit an own project idea,
                which I should implement with Grails 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see from the title, the general idea was based on a "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" game.
            </p>
            <p>More about the project can be found in the following chapters.</p>

            <h3>General conditions</h3>
            <p>
                The choice of front-end technology was up to us and is ideally cast in "Grails profiles".
                I have chosen the standard web profile, which works with Groovy Server Pages, short gsp.
            </p>

            <p>Other profiles like React, Angular and many more would have been possible.</p>

            <h3>Time</h3>
            <p>
                It was a lot of fun to work on this project! Even though I spent far more than 40 hours
                invested in it, I could try out a great framework and at the same time
                Get to know the programming language Groovy. This is valuable experience, which I will use well in the
                future can be.
            </p>

            <h3>Instruction</h3>

            <p>The most important application links are listed below.</p>

            <h2>This is what I'm proud of</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to point out a few points that I have implemented well in terms of implementation.
            </p>

            <h4>Anti Cheat Detection</h4>
            <p>
                If a player looses the game, presses the back button to "reanswer" his question, the anti cheat
                detection get's triggered and the game is aborted.
            </p>

            <h4>Zoom Logo</h4>
            <p>
                Who wants to be a millionaire logo on the home page has an "on hover" zoom animation.
                Actually this has taken a lot of time, but it was worth it, because the page looks less static now.
            </p>

            <h4>Design and layout</h4>
            <p>
                Design and layout in general is very well done. Bootstrap 4 runs through the
                application and gives it a uniform and stable touch.
            </p>

            <h4>50/50 wild cards</h4>
            <p>
                The 50/50 Joker is available in game mode and can only be used once per game. Thereby
                two wrong answers are eliminated from the current questions.
            </p>

            <h4>Responsive website</h4>
            <p>
                The website in general is dynamic: the 50/50 joker disappears as soon as it is played.
                Dynamic button names are also available in the moderator view. The button changes from "Show
                Answer" to "Hide Answer" as soon as it is clicked. "Clear Answer" sets the button
                always go back to "Show Answer" as well.
                I have experimented a lot with Javascript for these features and came up with very good results.
            </p>

            <h4>Initial Question Catalogue</h4>
            <p>
                Via an <b>online JSON-API</b> questions can be loaded dynamically (with fail-over on local questions) and users can directly open the app
                and play!
            </p>

            <h4>Valid HTML and CSS</h4>
            <p>
                Every HTML and CSS page has been validated with "https://validator.w3.org/nu/" and contains no errors
                anymore.
                The moderator view was the most difficult view to provide without errors.
            </p>

            <h3>Future Ideas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Highscore Table: Who went the furthest? Who was the fastest during game time?</li>
                <li>Create users.</li>
            </ul>
